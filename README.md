# SelfieStation
This is the code for my IBM winter internship interview assignment that helped get me an internship offer on IBM Research's AI Experience team. My project is an interactive smiley face meant to engage people who use IBM's Selfie Station, a kiosk where people can take selfies and save them in IBM's database with their information. The interactive smiley face is built with HTML5 Canvas.
